        “Material is the metaphor.\n\n”

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

In all countries, excluding India, paddies are worked by family labour alone and by the same methods as were used 2,000 years ago: hand cultivation with hoe and spade, or water-buffalo-, horse-, or ox- drawn plough with metal share. Paddy becomes rice after the removal of husk. Therefore, paddy is the rice with husk. \n Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world\'s human population, especially in Asia and Africa. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production. Rice was domesticated as early as 3500 BC, and by about 2,000 years ago it was grown in almost all of the present-day cultivation areas, predominantly deltas, floodplains and coastal plains, and some terraced valley slopes. \n \n CHARACTERISTICS OF RICE \n The rice plant can grow to 1–1.8 m tall, occasionally more depending on the variety and soil fertility. It has long, slender leaves 50–100 cm long and 2–2.5 cm broad. The small wind-pollinated flowers are produced in a branched arching to pendulous inflorescence 30–50 cm long. The edible seed is a grain 5–12 mm long and 2–3 mm thick. \n \n RICE GROWING ENVIRONMENTS \n Rice can be grown in different environments, depending upon water availability. Generally, rice does not thrive in a waterlogged area, yet it can survive and grow herein and it can survive flooding. \n 1. Lowland, rainfed, which is drought prone, favors medium depth; waterlogged, submergence, and flood prone \n 2. Lowland, irrigated, grown in both the wet season and the dry season \n 3. Deep water or floating rice \n 4. Coastal wetland \n 5. Upland rice is also known as Ghaiya rice, well known for its drought tolerance. \n \n ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS \n Temperature \n Rice requires high temperature above 20 °C but not more than 35 to 40 °C. Optimum temperature is around 30 °C and 20 °C \n Solar radiation \n The amount of solar radiation received during the 45 days leading up to harvest determines final crop output. \n Atmospheric water vapor \n High water vapor content subjects unusual stress which favors the spread of fungal and bacterial diseases. \n Wind \n Light wind transports CO2 to the leaf canopy but strong wind causes severe damage and may lead to sterility. \n TYPES OF RICE PRODUCED\n 1.Arborio rice. \n 2.Basmati rice. \n 3.Brown rice. \n 4.Jasmine rice. \n 5.White long grain rice. \n 6.Forbidden rice. \n 7.Wild rice. \n 8.Red rice. \n \n PESTS AND DISEASES \n Rice pests are any organisms or microbes with the potential to reduce the yield or value of the rice crop. Rice pests include weeds, pathogens, insects, nematode, rodents, and birds. \n \n Insects \n Major rice insect pests include: \n 1. The brown planthopper (BPH) \n 2. Several spp. of stemborers including those in the genera Scirpophaga and Chilo \n 3. The rice gall midge \n 4. Several spp. of rice bugs, notably in the genus Leptocorisa, defoliators such as the rice: leafroller, hispa and grasshoppers \n The fall army worm, a species of Lepidoptera, also targets and causes damage to rice crops. Rice weevils attack stored produce. \n \n Diseases \n Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea, is the most significant disease affecting rice cultivation. Other major rice diseases include: sheath blight, rice ragged stunt , and tungro. There is also an ascomycete fungus, Cochliobolus miyabeanus, that causes brown spot disease in rice. \n Nematodes \n Several nematode species infect rice crops, causing diseases such as Ufra, White tip disease and root knot disease. Some nematode species such as Pratylenchus spp. are most dangerous in upland rice of all parts of the world. Rice root nematode is a migratory endoparasite which on higher inoculum levels will lead to complete destruction of a rice crop. Beyond being obligate parasites, they also decrease the vigor of plants and increase the plants\' susceptibility to other pests and diseases. \n Other pests \n These include the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, panicle rice mice, rats, and the weed Echinochloa crusgali. \n \n PEST AND DISEASES CONTROL \n Many insect pests and pathogens attack rice plants at different growth stages of the crop as well as in storage. The first step is to identify the insect pests and pathogens and then determine the extent of damage to decide on proper control measures to be taken. \n Chemical pest control indicates the use of chemical pesticides to control pests and diseases. Pesticides are poisons that kill insects, pathogens and weeds, but some of them can also harm wildlife and humans, as well as pollute the environment. The common pesticides used in rice production in the field are: \n Carbaryl is a long-lasting, broad-spectrum pesticide that kills both insects and certain other invertebrates. Lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion and zeta-cypermethrin are all broad-spectrum pesticides used on rice. Copper sulfate pentahydrate and diflubenzuron are narrow-spectrum pesticides that have a moderate duration impact, lasting between a few days and two weeks. In addition, herbicides are used to control weeds. Calendar-based, preventive application of chemical pesticides is highly dangerous due to pollution of soil, air, and water. Hence, the most recommended advice to control insect pests in rice is to adopt integrated pest management (IPM). Two example of IPM tactics is given below. \n \n Cultural method \n • Remove collateral weed hosts from bunds and channels \n • Use only disease free seedlings \n • Avoid excess nitrogen \n • Apply N in three split doses (50% basal, 25% in tillering phase and 25% N in panicle initiation stage) \n • Use resistant variety CO 47. \n \n Chemical Method \n Spray after observing initial infection of the disease, \n • Carbendazim 50WP @ 500g/ hectare \n • Tricyclozole 75 WP @ 500g/ hectare \n • Metominostrobin 20 SC @ 500ml/hectare \n • Azoxystrobin 25 SC @ 500 ml/ hectare \n</string>

The soil type helps farmers decide what crops will grow best because some crops do better with particular types of soil.\n\n Testing the soil helps determine what nutrients are available or unavailable for growing certain crops. Farmers usually have local agricultural experts test the soil on their land for information on how to proceed in growing crops. \n\n The best soil has a balance of nutrients, such as potassium, magnesium, and others. Certain crops may need more of one nutrient, so farmers put back those ingredients into the soil for better crops. \n\n Here are six types of soil and what to grow in each: \n 1.

It involves the estimation and evaluation of the available nutrient status and acidic reaction of a sample of soil. After testing, a fertility map is prepared where the available nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium is marked as low, medium or high. Areas of sufficient and insufficient nutrients are marked out and nutritional requirements are determined. Fertilizers such as NPK, lime or gypsum are recommended to improve soil fertility. Fertilizer addition, which is based on soil testing, usually leads to an increase in yields and profits by providing the correct amounts of needed nutrients. It also leads to uniform application of nutrients in a field. As nutrient availability becomes less variable, the crop growth is more uniform. Regular soil testing also contributes to environmental sustainability as the use of excess fertilizers can be avoided\n\n</string>

Introduction\n Apple (Malus pumila) is an important temperate fruit. Apples are mostly consumed fresh but a small part of the production is processed in to juices, jellies, canned slices and other items. An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. \n\n In India, Apple is primarily cultivated in Jammu & Kashmir; Himachal Pradesh; hills of Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal. It is also cultivated to a small extent in Arunachal Pradesh; Nagaland; Punjab and Sikkim. \n\n 2. Climate\n The apple is a temperate fruit crop. However, in India the apple growing areas do not fall in temperate zone but the prevailing temperate climate of the region is due to the Himalayan ranges and high altitudes. The average summer temperature should be around 21–24oC during active growth period. Apple succeeds best in regions where the trees experience uninterrupted rest in winter and abundant sunshine for good colour development. It can be grown at an altitude of 1500– 2700 m above the sea level. Well–distributed rainfall of 1000-1250 mm throughout the growing season is most favourable for optimum growth and fruitfulness of apple trees. \n\n 3. Soil\n Apples grow best on a well-drained, loam soils having a depth of 45 cm and a pH range of pH 5.5-6.5. The soil should be free from hard substrata and water-logged conditions. Soils with heavy clay or compact subsoil are to be avoided. \n\n]]></string>

If there is insufficient humidity, you can increase it by putting containers of water in the place where the apples are being stored. Not all varieties of apple are suitable for storing. The apples should either be stored on fruit racks or in fl at boxes. The boxes can be lined with wood shavings or corrugated paper. In the case of taller boxes, put corrugated paper between the layers of fruit to prevent pressure marks. Only store healthy and undamaged fruit. Maggot–ridden, overripe and outsized fruit cannot be stored for long and should be sorted out when harvesting. Apples without a stalk should be eaten early as they can rot quickly. Check your fruit store on a weekly basis and remove all rotten apples. Rotten pipfruit can ‘infect’ other fruit. This is due to emerging ethylene, a colourless gas, which ripens the other apples more quickly and, in some cases, spoils them. For precisely this reason apples should not be stored together with other fruit and vegetables. In order to prevent apples from drying out quickly, the boxes can be covered with a perforated fi lm. Alternatively, apples can also be stored in perforated polythene bags since the release of ethylene is reduced by the bag. In all cases, stored pip fruit should be checked regularly so that rotten apples can be removed quickly. Apples have a long storage life compared to other fruits and can be stored for a period of 4-8 months after harvesting. The fruits can be kept in cold storage at a temperature of about – 1.1 to 0 °C and 85-90% relative humidity.</string>

Please don’t just rip them off the branches. An apple is only ripe for harvesting when it can be picked easily, i.e. when the stalk of the apple comes away from the tree easily if you twist it. Further indications of an apple being ready to harvest are a wide and deep calyx and brown pips. Readiness for picking and eating diff ers, however, from variety to variety. While harvesting never pull the fruit off the tree. This will disturb the tree, usually causing other fruit to fall and can lead to signifi cant bruising. This method can also result in fruit spurs being removed with the apples, reducing next year’s crop potential. One of the easiest picking techniques is the “rolling method”. Using this method the apple is gently turned upside down on the spur. If the fruit is ready to pick it usually separates easily without disturbing other apples or the fruit spur. The thumb or another fi nger is often placed between the apple stem and the spur as the apple is rolled upwards. Set all apples carefully in the picking container. Do not drop the fruit or jostle the container. Fruit hitting other fruit or hitting the side of the container, causes bruising. People with large hands and/or long fi ngers may eventually be able to remove two apples at a time per hand. Do not encourage this practice until they master picking individual fruits bruise-free. \n\n</string>

It contains maximum quantity of limonene (60%) besides L-pinene, ß-pinene, sabenene, myrcene, L- phellandrene, thymol, carvone etc. The seeds are crushed and immediately sent for distillation to avoid loss of oil by evaporation. The seeds are to be spread evenly on the perforated grids with which a still, serving for steam distillation should be equipped. The whole process of distillation lasts for 10-12 hours.

The crop is resistant to adverse climatic conditions and improve the soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen in the soil.\n It has been reported that the crop produces equivalent to 22.10 kg of N/ha., which has been estimated to be supplement of 59 thousand tonnes of urea annually. \n The pulse \'Black gram\' plays an important role in Indian diet, as it contains vegetable protein and supplement to cereal based diet. It contains about 26% protein, which is almost three times that of cereals and other minerals and vitamins. Besides, it is also used as nutritive fodder, specially for milch animals.\n Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh are major blackgram growing states area-wise. The highest yield was recorded by the state of Bihar (898 kg/ha) followed by Sikkim (895 kg/ha) and Jharkhand (890 kg/ha).\n The National yield average is 585 kg/ha.

The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common wheat (T. aestivum). Wheat is the second most important staple food after rice consumed by 65% of the population in India and is likely to increase further due to changes in food habits. Wheat is mostly consumed in the form of ‘chapatti’ in our country for which bread wheat is cultivated in nearly 95 per cent of the cropped area. Durum wheat, which is most suitable for making macaroni, noodles, semolina and pasta products, occupies about 4 to 5% of the area, and is predominantly grown in Central and Peninsular parts of India. \n\n Land preparation \n One deep ploughing, two light ploughings followed by harrowing. Apply 3 t. FYM manure at last ploughing to the soil. \n\n Seeds and sowing \n • The optimum time of sowing for wheat is when the mean daily temperature is between 23±3°C and for good tillering temperature should range between 16-20°C. \n • Under irrigated timely sown condition, the wheat sowing may be done in the first fortnight of November in NHZ, NWPZ & PZ and the middle of November in NEPZ and CZ. \n • Under late sown conditions, the wheat sowing may be done in the first fortnight of December in NHZ, NWPZ, NEPZ and CZ whereas in the last week of November to first week of December in PZ. \n The timely sown varieties may be grown up to middle of December in NWPZ (PBW 343, PBW 502) and CZ (GW 322 and GW 273) whereas in NEPZ varieties recommended for different sowing conditions may be grown for higher productivity. In PZ timely sown varieties (Raj 4037 and GW 322) may be grown across all sowing times for higher productivity. \n • Seed rate of 100 kg/ha at 38 g/1000 seeds is required under irrigated timely sown conditions. \n • In case of FIRBS seed rate may be reduced to 75 kg/ha. \n • For late sown and rainfed conditions seed rate should be increased to 125 kg/ha. \n • Seeding depth should be around 5±2 cm with a row spacing of 20-23 cm. \n • For late sown wheat reduce the line spacing to 15-18 cm. \n\n Integrated Nutrient management \n • Fertiliser requirement for irrigated timely sown conditions is 120:60:40 kg N:P2O5:K2O/ha in NHZ, CZ, PZ and 150:60:40 kg N:P2O5:K2O/ha in NWPZ and NEPZ whereas for late sown it is 90:60:40 kg N:P2O5:K2O/ha in NHZ, CZ, PZ and 120:60:40 kg N:P2O5:K2O/ha in NWPZ and NEPZ. \n • Full P and K with 1/3rd N are to be applied as basal and the rest 2/3rd N should be applied at first node stage at around 40-45 days after seeding. \n • In general, all the fertiliser @ 90:30 kg N:P2O5/ha is applied at the time of sowing as basal under rainfed conditions. \n]]></string>

The fungi overwinter in dead twigs and fallen leaves. Cool, rainy weather creates perfect conditions for the spores to spread. Dry and hot weather stop the progression of the disease that may begin again once the weather conditions become optimal. The problem can be cyclic but is rarely fatal.\n\n</string>

Potted plants and greenhouse crops such as cyclamen, ficus, lupine, palms, succulents and yuccas are sometimes affected. Trees and shrubs that are prone to anthracnose include maple, camellia, walnut, ash, azalea, oak and sycamore.\n\n</string>

Picking up and disposing of all diseased plant parts, including twigs and leaves, from the ground or from around the plant is important. This keeps the fungus from overwintering near the plant. Proper pruning techniques to rid trees and plants of old and dead wood also helps with prevention of anthracnose fungus. Keeping plants healthy by providing proper light, water and fertilizer will strengthen the plant’s ability to ward off a fungus attack. Stressed trees and plants have a difficult time recovering from anthracnose fungus. Chemical treatment is rarely used except when the disease involves newly transplanted plants or continual defoliation.\n\n</string>

Chemical control has been largely ineffective in minimizing bacterial blight because of safety concerns, practicality, and bacterial resistance. Biological control methods, which rely on the use of bacterial antagonists of pathogens, can reduce bacterial blight, though their use has been limited. The most-common method of defending against rice bacterial blight is the cultivation of rice varieties with genes that confer resistance to Xoo infection. Over 30 resistance genes, termed Xa1 to Xa33, have been identified in rice plants, and some, such as Xa21, have been integrated into the genomes of commercial rice strains. These resistant rice varieties have been largely successful, dramatically reducing yield losses in many rice-producing countries. \n\n</string>

In bearing trees, the growth of leader and strong laterals are encouraged by pruning weak and crowded branches. \n • Renewal System : In vigorous cultivars \n instead of developing permanent spurs, the \n objective is to encourage continuous growth\n of new healthy shoots, spurs and branches every year. \n A part of the tree is pruned every year to produce fruits in the following year on the new\n shoot growth, while the unpruned parts produces fruit buds. \n</string>

The seed contains 2 – 3% essential oil and 17 – 18% fatty oil. The essential oil has d-selenene, sedlanolide and sedanoic acid anhydride contributing to its flavour and 60% of d-limonene. The crop is grown as a winter annual for its seed and seed oil, used for flavouring tinned food and sauces. It is also used in pickles. The seed has carminative and nerve stimulant properties; it is used as a neuro-tonic in domestic medicine. The leaves are used in salad and also cooked as vegetable.\n Celery is a herbaceous plant, usually 60 to 120 cm. high with white flowers borne in compound umbels. Annual cultures are grown in India mainly for seed purpose. Root is succulent, well developed with numerous lateral roots. Stems are branched, angular, jointed and light green in colour. Leaves are oblong, 7-18 cm. long, pinnate or trifoliate. It throws up a flowering head in later part of autumn producing a mass of fruits. The flowers are white or greenish white, very small on sessile compound umbels. When the umbels dry, the crop is harvested and threshed. The fruit is made up of two united umbels, each containing a seed. Celery seeds are very small, about 1-2 mm. in length, oval and greenish brown in colour. The celery seed has a pleasingly crisp texture and subtle flavour but a slightly bitter taste.</string>

Spray 0.02% ai. Chloropyriphos after sunset results in complete knock down adult beetles in Karewa conditions of Kashmir. Biological control with Beauveria bassiana 108 spores/ml has also been found effective when integrated with chemical fungicides.\n For root grubs: \n Metarhizium anisopliae \n •Metarhizium is naturally occurring entamopathogenic fungi which act as Bio-control agent against arthropods. Once the fungal spores attach to the surface of the insect, it germinates and begin to grow, then they penetrate the exoskeleton of the insect and grow very rapidly inside the insect, causing the insect to die. Other insects that come in contact with infected insects also gets infected by the fungus and die. Composition \n Special features: \n It is pathogenic to pests like Root weevils, plant hoppers, Japanese beetle, black vine weevil, spittlebug and white grubs.\n It is safe to natural enemies of pest such as benecial parasites and benecial predators and thus offers a long-lasting pest control. \n The resistance of the fungus lasts for 3 years after the application. \n It forms a good molecule for use in an IPM programme and thereby helps to reduce the pesticide load in the atmosphere. \n It helps to increase productivity by improving the crop health through controlling the pests. \n It is eco-friendly and helps to maintain the ecological balance. \n Dosage & Application: \n Drip Irrigation: Mix 1 liter of Metarhizium in 100 liters of water and apply using drip irrigation system. \n Soil Application: Mix 5 kg or 1 liter of Metarhizium with 100 kg compost incubate for 4 days and apply to the one acre field. \n Seedling (Root Dipping): Mix 1 liter or 2 kg of Metarhizium in 10 liters of water, keep the seedling roots in immersed condition for 30 minutes and transfer it to the eld. \n Soil Drenching : Mix 5kg or 1 liter of Metarhizium in 100-200 liters of water and drench 500ml solution near root zone of crop.]]></string>

The soil should be deep because the roots usually penetrate 3 m or deeper. Asparagus is fairly tolerant to high salt content and alkaline conditions. It is sensitive to high soil acidity and grows well in soil with a pH of 6 to 6,7. Lime should be applied to soils with a pH lower than 5,5 before planting.\n Land preparation: \n 1.Soil tests should be done in the first year and then every other year, and lime should be applied according to soil test results. Asparagus should not be planted in any field in which it had been planted in the past.\n 2.The soil should be fumigated to reduce the incidence of Fusarium wilt and several root rots if planted in fields previously planted to asparagus. Sites which retain standing water for more than eight hours after a heavy rain should be avoided.\n 3.The site should also be fairly level, free of rocks and weeds such as Bermuda grass, nutgrass and Johnson grass. It is recommended that the soil should first be loosened to a depth of at least 450 mm, using a ripper.\n 4.The soil should be ploughed deep after fertilizing and the furrows ploughed open with a plough. Prepare about 45 cm broad ridges for plantation leaving 20 cm furrow space as a channel for irrigation.</string>

Germination starts in 7 to 10 days after the first shower of monsoon in June month.\n Climate Temperature: \n Asparagus is adapted to grow in a wide variety of weather conditions. It produces better quality and higher yields when it matures during periods when the temperatures are about 16° to 25 °C, especially after a long period of fern growth. The growing period is shortened in colder climates because of the limited period for fern production. Spear growth is rapid during warmer conditions, resulting in greater fibre production within the spears. Spear tips also tend to lose some compactness under the conditions mentioned.\n Rainfall: \n Adequate moisture should be maintained for good germination and early seedling growth, especially during the first two months. Water stress during this early stage can lead to reduced yields during the life of the planting.</string>

An average yield of 5 to 6 tonnes of dry roots can be obtained. \n Post-harvest handling: \n Fresh asparagus is highly perishable and deteriorates rapidly at high temperatures. Spear growth, loss of tenderness, loss of flavour, loss of vitamin C, and development of decay can also occur at moderately high temperatures. Therefore, the harvested crop must be rapidly precooled, preferably by hydro cooling before packing and kept at a low temperature and high relative humidity. The spears should also be washed.\n 1.SORTING For the fresh market, spears that are crooked or malformed, and those with open green tips or a ridge at the butt end should be discarded.\n 2.GRADING: \n Asparagus spears are graded according to thickness and tied in bunches. Good-quality spears are clean, straight, tender, long, large in diameter and bright green with compact tips. The spears should be uniform in length.\n 3.PACKING:\n The bundles are packed into cartons or wooden boxes. They may be packed unwrapped, or in cellophane or plastic wrappers. It is not advisable to pack asparagus in non- perforated film because the extent of increase in carbon dioxide and decrease in oxygen may be damaging and because enough ethylene may accumulate and toughen the spears.\n 4.STORAGE: \n Storage temperatures are between 0° and 2 °C, with a relative humidity of 90%. High relative humidity helps to prevent desiccation, particularly at the butt ends and it is frequently obtained by placing the butts of asparagus on wet pads or prepackaging spears in perforated film. The packaged product must be held in an upright position because the spears continue to elongate. If stored in a horizontal position, the spear tips will bend upward, thereby affecting their market appearance. Asparagus should not be stored with apples or other ethylene-producing material as it may be damaged by exposure to this gas. Undesirable elongation, curving and toughening may result from adverse exposure to ethylene.\n 5.TRANSPORT: \n Asparagus should always be shipped under refrigeration. The crop for canning should be transported to the factories at least 5 to 10 hours after harvesting. \n 6.MARKETING: \n Asparagus is marketed fresh or canned.</string>

Two to Three weedings should be carried out during the rainy season and subsequent weeding should be done one in 2 to 3 months. Mulch the beds to prevent weed growth and retain soil moisture.\n 2.Usually, male plants produce more and better spears and most of the modern cultivars are all-male. Remove any female plants from the field. Female plants are easy to notice because they produce orange-red berries.\n Cultural practices:\n Ridging: \n Ridging is done when white or blanched asparagus is required.

It is one of the most popular and widely grown vegetables in the region and has occupied second position in production after potato. It is a rich source of vitamin A, C and mineral including potassium, calcium, sodium and iron. Cabbage is grown throughout the country but it is more popular in Southern States where it is available all the year round. In northern India also, the cabbage availability period has been considerably extended with the development of tropical varieties/hybrids. The outer leaves are generally larger than the inner. The stem is short and stout. Plants flower generally after winter. It is good sources of protein (1.3 per cent) which contains all essential amino acids, particularly sulphur containing amino acids. Flavour in cabbage leaves is due to the glycoside sinigrin. Cabbage contains goitrogens which cause enlargement of thyroid glands. Cabbage is commonly used as cooked vegetable. It also makes into a good salad mixed in tomato, green chillies, beet root, etc. Nice pickle is prepared from cabbage.\n The major cabbage producing states are Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Karnataka.</string>

Cabbage should be harvested promptly when the heads are firm and mature. Delaying harvest, even a few days beyond maturity can result in split heads and increased incidence of field disease.\n Harvesting immature heads, however, reduces yield, and the heads are too soft to resist handling damage. Immature heads also have a shorter shelf life than mature heads.\n The head is harvested by bending it to one side and cutting it with a knife. The stalk should be cut flat and as close to the head as possible, yet long enough to retain two to four wrapper leaves. Extra leaves act as cushions during handling and may be desired in certain markets.\n Yield :\n Yield of the cabbage varies greatly depending upon variety, maturity group and season of cultivation. Average yield obtained from early varieties is 25-30 t/ha and that of late type is 40-60 t/ha.\n Post-harvest handling:\n Storage:\n Defective cabbage showing signs of insect damage, freezing damage, and sunscald and bruising should be discarded or marketed prior to storage. Harvesting cabbages soon as mature will prevent cracking of heads. Cabbage intended for long-term storage (5-6 months) should be stored at 0°C and 98-100% relative humidity.\n Packing:\n An environmental group is working with a retailer and a cabbage grower-shipper to switch to emissions Marketing:\n The majority of cabbage is used in processing for coleslaw (45%), followed by fresh head cabbage (35%), sauerkraut (12%) and other fresh-cut products (5-10%).\n Fresh cabbage markets and sauerkraut markets are distinct, with the majority of sauerkraut grown under contract between grower and buyer.</string>

If necessary, the seed bed may be disinfected by soil drenching or sterilization. Manuring should be restricted to FYM (or cowdung manures) @ 6-8 tonnes/ha. If necessary, both phosphorous and potash may be added @ 50-75 kg and 150-200 kg/ha respectively.\n •The seed is sown in 200-300 sq m seed bed area at the rate of 1 to 2 per sq m. One g seed would give rise to about 100 seedlings.\n •Sowing should be sown in rows and sowing too close may cause the seedlings to be lanky. Seeds should be sown in correct depth since deeper sowing will delay germination and will create other problems also.\n •A depth of 1.5 to 2 cm would be optimum. A good moisture supply for rapid and optimum germination is essential.\n Seed treatment: \n Treat the seeds in hot water @ 50C for 30 minutes. 25g of Azospirillum is required for the seed treatment of 250g cabbage seeds.\n Transplanting: \n Sowing, transplanting and choice of cultivar have to be done after very careful consideration of the area for growing in the country since the temperature plays the most important role on the performance. Most parts of the country have a comparatively short cooler period and, therefore, all cultivars belonging to early, midseason or late may not do well. In such areas, cultivars maturing between 60-90 days of transplanting would do well, especially of the tropical types. Since these are not yet available, early cultivars like Golden Acre, Pride of India, Copenhagen Market, etc., are likely to do well. \n Spacing: \n Hills : 40 x 40 cm \n Plains : 45 x 30 cm \n Hybrid: 60x 45x45cm in paired row system.\n Seed rate:\n 650gm/ha of seeds is required.</string>

In the Orient, it is usually called balimbing, belimbing, or belimbing manis (sweet belimbing), to distinguish it from the bilimbi or belimbing asam, A. bilimbi L. In Ceylon and India, the carambola has the alternate names of kamaranga, kamruk, or other variants of the native kamrakh. The carambola tree is slow-growing, short-trunked with a much-branched, bushy, broad, rounded crown and reaches 20 to 30 ft (6-9 m) in height. Its deciduous leaves, spirally arranged, are alternate, imparipinnate, 6 to 10 in(15-20 cm) long, with 5 to 11 nearly opposite leaflets, ovate or ovate-oblong, 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 in (3.8-9 cm) long; soft, medium-green, and smooth on the upper surface, finely hairy and whitish on the underside. The leaflets are sensitive to light and more or less inclined to fold together at night or when the tree is shaken or abruptly shocked. Small clusters of red-stalked, lilac, purple-streaked, downy flowers, about 1/4 in (6 mm) wide, are borne on the twigs in the axils of the leaves. The showy, oblong, longitudinally 5- to 6-angled fruits, 2 1/2 to 6 in (6.35-15 cm) long and up to 3 1/2 (9 cm) wide, have thin, waxy, orange-yellow skin and juicy, crisp, yellow flesh when fully ripe. Slices cut in cross-section have the form of a star. The fruit has a more or less pronounced oxalic acid odor and the flavor ranges from very sour to mildly sweetish. The so-called sweet types rarely contain more than 4% sugar. There may be up to 12 flat, thin, brown seeds 1/4 to 1/2 in (6-12.5 mm) long or none at all.</string>

In Florida, the tree survives in sheltered sites as far north as St. Petersburg on the west coast and Daytona Beach on the east. It thrives up to an elevation of 4,000 ft (1,200 m) in India. In an interior valley of Israel, all trees succumbed to the prevailing hot, dry winds. The carambola needs moisture for best performance and ideally rainfall should be fairly evenly distributed all year. In Australia, it is claimed that fruit quality and flavor are best where annual rainfall is 70 in (180 cm) or somewhat more.\n Soil: \n Not too particular as to soil, the carambola does well on sand, heavy clay or limestone, but will grow faster and bear more heavily in rich loam. It is often chlorotic on limestone. It needs good drainage; cannot stand flooding.</string>

A selection from the resulting seedlings was vegetatively propagated during the 1940\'s and 1950\'s and, in late 1965, was officially released under the name \'Golden Star\' and distributed to growers. The fruit is large, deeply winged, decorative, and mildly subacid to sweet. Furthermore, this cultivar shows the least minor-element deficiency in alkaline soil, and even isolated trees bear well and regularly without cross-pollination.\n Several cultivars from Taiwan are being grown at the United States Department of Agriculture\'s Subtropical Horticulture Research Unit in Miami, including \'Mih Tao\' (P. I. No. 272065) introduced in 1963, also \'Dah Pon\' and \'Tean Ma\' and others identified only by numbers, and Fwang Tung\' brought from Thailand by Dr. R J. Knight in 1973. There are certain lines of carambola, such as \'Newcomb\', \'Thayer\' and \'Arkin\' being grown commercially in southern Florida. Some cultivars and seedlings bear flowers with short styles, others only flowers with long styles, a factor which affects self- and cross-pollination.</string>

The fruits are packed solidly, stem-end down, at a 45º angle, the flanges of one fruit fitting into the V grooves of another. Of course, they cannot endure rough handling.\n In storage trials at Winter Haven, Florida, carambolas picked when showing the first signs of yellowing kept in good condition for 4 weeks at 50º F (10º C); 3 weeks at 60º F (15.56º C); 2 weeks at 70º F (21.1º C).

In Malaya, they are produced all the year. In Florida, scattered fruits are found through the year but the main crop usually matures from late summer to early winter. Some trees have fruited heavily in November and December, and again in March and April. There may even be three crops. Weather conditions account for much of the seasonal variability.\n The fruits naturally fall to the ground when fully ripe.

In Malaya, fruit flies (especially Dacus dorsalis) are so troublesome on carambolas that growers have to wrap the fruits on the tree with paper. Experimental trapping, with methyl eugenol as an attractant, has reduced fruit damage by 20%. In Florida, a small stinkbug causes superficial blemishes and a black beetle attacks overripe fruits. Reniform nematodes may cause tree decline.Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides may be a problem in Florida, and leaf spot may arise from attack by Phomopsis sp., Phyllosticta sp. or Cercospora averrhoae.Cercospora leaf spot is reported also from Malaya, Ceylon, China and may occur in the Philippines as well. A substance resembling sooty mold makes many fruits unmarketable in summer.</string>

A spacing of 20 ft (6 m) has been advocated but if the trees are on good soil no less than 30 ft (9 m) should be considered. At the Research Center in Homestead, trees 8 to 10 ft (2.4-3 m) high respond well to 1 lb (0.5 kg) applications of N, P, K, Mg in the ratio of 6- 6-6-3 given 3 to 4 times per year. If chlorosis occurs, it can be corrected by added iron, zinc and manganese. Some advisers recommend minor-element spraying 4 times during the year if the trees are on limestone soils. Moderate irrigation is highly desirable during dry seasons. Heavy rains during blooming season interfere with pollination and fruit production. Interplanting of different strains is usually necessary to provide cross-pollination and obtain the highest yields.</string>

Only plump, fully developed seeds should be planted. In damp peat moss, they will germinate in one week in summer, require 14 to 18 days in winter. The seedlings are transplanted to containers of light sandy loam and held until time to set out. They are very tender and need good care. Seedlings are highly variable. Air-layering has been practiced and advocated. However, root formation is slow and later performance is not wholly satisfactory. Inarching is successful in India, shield-budding in the Philippines and the Forkert method in Java. Trees can be top-worked by bark-grafting, a popular technique in Java. For mass production, side-veneer grafting of mature, purplish wood, onto carambola seedlings gives best results for most workers. The rootstocks should be at least 1 year old and 3/8 to 5/7 in (1-1.5 cm) thick. One Florida farmer prefers cleft-grafting of green budwood and has 90% success. Grafted trees will fruit in 10 months from the time of planting out. Mature trees can be top-worked by bark-grafting.</string>

They may be irrigated at an interval of 10-15days till the onset of monsoon.\n Intercultural operations: \n 1.Mulching: \n It is an important cultural practice in cardamom. Fallen leaves of the shade trees are utilized for mulching. Sufficient mulch should be applied during November-December to reduce the ill effects of drought, which prevails for nearly 4-5 months during summer. Exposing the panicle over mulch is beneficial for pollination.\n 2.Weeding: \n The first round of weeding is to be carried in May-June, the second in August-September and the third in December-January. Weedicides like paraquat @625ml in 500 litres (Gramoxone - 3l/500l) of water may be sprayed in the interspaces between rows leaving 60cm around the plant base.\n 3.Trashing: \n Trashing consists of removing old and drying shoots of the plant once in a year with the onset of monsoon under rainfed conditions and 2-3 times in high density plantations provided with irrigated facilities.\n 4.Shade regulation :\n Moderate shade : 50-60 %, Rainfed : 40 – 50 %, Irrigated : 55-60 %.\n 5.Earthing up: \n After the monsoon is over, a thin layer of fresh fertile soil, rich in organic matter may be earthed up at the base of the clump, covering up to the collar region be scraping between the rows or collecting soil from staggered trenches/check pits. This encourages new growth.\n Pollination can be enhanced by keeping bee hives at 10 – 15 Nos./ha.\n Horticulture Special: \n Special Features: Application of Horticulture special for fruit crops controls premature shedding of flowers and results in improved fruit setting.\n >It also improves fruit color, size and taste and also helps in better fruit setting, resulting in better quality produce and higher yield.\n Dosage & Application: \n >Foliar Spray: Mix 3 ml of Horticulture Special in a liter of water and spray on both the surfaces of leaves.\n >First spray: Just before flowering i.e. during new leaf emergence.\n >Second spray: During flowering or 25 days after first spray.\n >Third spray: When the fruits are of bean size i.e. after 25 days after second spray.]]></string>

In most of the areas the peak period of harvest is during October-November. Picking is carried out at an interval of 15-25 days. Ripe capsules are harvested in order to get maximum green colour during curing. After harvest, capsules are dried either in fuel kiln or electrical drier or in the sun. It has been found that soaking the freshly harvested green cardamom capsules in 2% washing soda solution for 10 minutes prior to drying helps to retain the green colour during drying. When drier is used, it should be dried at 45-50o C for 14-18 hours, while for kiln, over night drying at 50-60 o C is required. The capsules kept for drying are spread thinly and stirred frequently to ensure uniform drying. The dried capsules are rubbed with hands or coir mat or wire mesh and winnowed to remove any foreign matter. They are then sorted out according to size and colour, and stored in black polythene lined gunny bags to retain the green colour during storage..</string>

The optimum temperature for growth of young plants is around 23oC, but in later stages 17-20oC are most favourable. The tropical cultivars show growth even at 35oC. In temperate regions, the growth of young seedlings may be ceased, when temperatures are slightly about 0oC, while, the early cultivars grown in plains of north India and other tropical parts can grow even at 35oC or still higher temperature. Lower temperatures ranging from 5oC to 28-30oC are needed for transition from vegetative to curding phase. The temperature higher or lower than the optimum required for curd formation of the cultivars may cause physiological disorder viz. riceyness, leafy curd and blindness.\n Sowing Time: \n The optimum time of seed sowing in the nursery varies greatly depending upon climate, varieties and their temperature requirement for curd formation. The nursery for mid season crop can be grown successfully by protection of beds from heavy rains during July-August is essential. The seedlings for mid late and late crop can be conveniently raised, because of favourable temperature conditions.</string>

In light soil, the plants are most sensitive to drought and therefore, adequate moisture supply is important. For early crops, the light soils are preferred, while, loamy and clay loam soils are more suitable for mid season and late maturing types. Cauliflower is relatively more sensitive to deficiency of boron and molybdenum, and it has high requirement of magnesium. The deficiency of magnesium may quickly appears in acid soils. High pH reduces the availability of boron.\n Preparation of Land: \n Bring the soil to fine tilth and pits should be taken at a spacing of 45 cm either way in hills. Form ridges and furrows at 60 cm in plains. The planting distance may vary according to the variety, climate and soil. Normally, the seedlings of early varieties are planted to 60 cm row to row and 30-45 cm plant to plant distance. The main season and late varieties are planted at spacing of 60-75 cm between rows and 45-60 cm between plants.</string>

The edible part of cauliflower is known as curd, which consists of a shoot system with short internodes, branches apices and bracts. The edible portion of this vegetable is approximately 45 per cent of the vegetable as purchased. It has high quality of proteins and peculiar in stability of vitamin C after cooking. It is rich in minerals such as potassium, sodium, iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium etc. Some of the states that produce large quantities of cauliflower are Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Odisha and Karnataka.</string>
